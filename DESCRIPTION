Description: This is a modified version of the thesisdown package which uses the 
    bookdown package and LaTeX thesis template from Reed College to
    encourage reproducible research using simple Markdown syntax while embedding 
    all of the R code to produce plots and analyses as well. The modifications made
    are for use in Macquarie University HDR theses.
